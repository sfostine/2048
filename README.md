# 2048
Summer time!!! Creating 2048 game for fun

This is my own version of 2048 game
It is flexible to work on any board with a miximum of 11 columns and 7 rows.
Note that you can play on any board within the range mentioned earlier
Example of board: 4X4, 2X1, 3X4, 4X5, and so one.
What if you don't want to finish the game, you can also try the 11X7.

We have different color for each number using in the game

Next feature that I'll be working on, is to have the possibility to go to 3 or 5 previous steps.
Some other features will be added.
