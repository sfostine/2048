# 2048
Summer time!!! Creating 2048 game for fun

This is my own version of 2048 game
It is flexible to work on any board with a miximum of 11 columns and 7 rows.
Note that you can play on any board within the range mentioned earlier
Example of board: 4X4, 7X2, 11X7, 8X6, and so on.

We have different color for each number using in the game

Next feature that I'll be working on, is to have the possibility to go to 3 or 5 previous steps.
Some other features will be added.
